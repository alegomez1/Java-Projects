Pseudo code for Challenge 6
Constructor Class
Create two static int arrays: lotteryNumbers and userLotteryPicks. Define them to hold six values
Create a Lottery constructor
Create an instance of the Random class called myRan
Create six int variables called num1-num6
Set each of these variables to be a random number from 1-60

getUserPicks()
Create an instance of the Scanner class called keyboard
Show the user the six numbers that the constructor already generated by using an enhanced for loop to cycle through each element of the lotteryNumbers array
Ask the user to enter six numbers of their own
Validate that these numbers are unique and there are no repetitions
Run a for loop six times that takes input from the user in the form of a number from 1-60
That number then gets set to the userLotteryPicks array at index i
